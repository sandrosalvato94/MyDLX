fancyhdr – Extensive control of page headers and footers in LaTeX2ε

The package provides extensive facilities, both for constructing headers and footers, and for controlling their use (for example, at times when LaTeX would automatically change the heading style in use).

The package consists of the following files:

README				 This file
fancyhdr.sty		 the LaTeX package
fancyhdr.tex		 extensive documentation file
fancyhdr.pdf  		 PDF of the above
fancyheadings.sty	 this loads fancyhdr with a warning message
extramarks.sty 		 a package for additional marks

Fancyhdr is a replacement for the old LaTeX2 package fancyheadings. That
one should not be used anymore. The package fancyheadings included here
just loads fancyhdr with a warning message.

The documentation (fancyhdr.tex/fancyhdr.pdf) describes both
fancyhdr.sty and extramarks.sty.
In order to latex the documentation you need to have a copy of
boxedminipage.sty (CTAN:/macros/latex/contrib/boxedminipage) installed.

There used to be a package fixmarks.sty, but that is obsolete. It fixed
a problem in LaTeX, but that is now solved in the LaTeX2ε system itself.
So it is no longer included.

fancyhdr.sty version 3 and extramarks.sty version 2 are the packages as
described in the second edition of The LaTeX Companion. But that
documentation should also suffice for the newer versions.

LICENCE: All files in this package may be distributed under the terms of
the LaTeX Project Public License, as described in lppl.txt in the base
LaTeX distribution. Either version 1 or, at your option, any later
version.
